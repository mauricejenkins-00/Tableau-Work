# Tableau Work

For this project I chose two datasets, SEPT 2020 & 2021 citi bikes ride logs. After collecting my data, I imported both files into Jupyter Lab and began to aggregrate through each dataset to find phenomena and organize each files data before importing that data into Tableau. In tableau I created visualizations to tell a story of the changes in 2020's ride data, and 2021's ride data. I've uploaded the jupyter notebook holding all code used to perform my analysis, it is called citibikes_notebook.
