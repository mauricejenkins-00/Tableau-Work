# Tableau Work

For this project I chose two datasets, SEPT 2020 & 2021 citi bikes ride logs, both containing two million+ entries. After collecting my data, I imported both files into Jupyter Lab and began to perform ETL procedures, and aggregrate through each dataset to find phenomena and organize each file's data before importing that data into Tableau. In tableau I created visualizations to tell a story of the changes in 2020's ride data, and 2021's ride data. I've uploaded the jupyter notebook holding all code used to perform my analysis, it is called citibikes_notebook.
